# ADR-010: Package Organization Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

### The Problem: Where Should Code Live?

Go projects have flexibility in how they organize packages, particularly around:
- **`pkg/`** - Traditionally for public APIs meant to be imported by external projects
- **`internal/`** - Private packages that cannot be imported externally
- **`cmd/`** - Command-line applications
- **Root directory** - Where application entry points live

This flexibility creates questions:
- Should we expose a public API via `pkg/`?
- Where do we draw the boundary between public and private?
- How do we communicate project intent through structure?
- What prevents accidental API surface expansion?

### Why This Matters for ckeletin-go

**ckeletin-go is a production-ready Go CLI scaffold powered by an updatable framework layer.** It is primarily a CLI tool, but it also hosts public reusable packages in `pkg/` (e.g., `checkmate` for beautiful terminal output). This dual nature should be:
1. **Visible** - Structure shows "CLI-first, with optional public packages"
2. **Enforced** - `pkg/` packages must be standalone (no `internal/` imports)
3. **Documented** - Clear criteria for what belongs in `pkg/`
4. **Validated** - Automated checks enforce boundaries

Without clear organization:
- Business logic might leak into root directory
- `pkg/` packages might depend on `internal/`, breaking standalone reusability
- Framework code (`.ckeletin/`) might get mixed with project code
- New developers won't know where code belongs

### Alternatives Considered

**1. Traditional Go Project Layout (cmd/, pkg/, internal/)**
```
project/
├── cmd/           # CLI applications
├── pkg/           # Public library code
└── internal/      # Private implementation
```
- **Pros**: Well-known pattern, supports both CLI and library
- **Cons**: Maintenance burden for public API packages
- **Why chosen**: ckeletin-go is CLI-first but also provides public packages (e.g., `pkg/checkmate/`). This layout matches our actual use case.

**2. Library-First Layout (pkg/, cmd/ optional)**
```
project/
├── pkg/           # Primary public API
├── internal/      # Private helpers
└── cmd/           # Optional CLI wrapper
```
- **Pros**: Clear library intent, common for SDK projects
- **Cons**: Wrong signal - we're a CLI tool first
- **Why not**: Inverts our actual priority (CLI is the product)

**3. Flat Structure (everything at root)**
```
project/
├── command1.go
├── command2.go
└── utils.go
```
- **Pros**: Simple, no directory overhead
- **Cons**: Scales poorly, no boundaries, everything public
- **Why not**: Doesn't scale, exposes everything

**4. Monorepo Style (apps/, libs/, packages/)**
```
project/
├── apps/ckeletin/     # CLI application
├── libs/config/       # Shared libraries
└── packages/utils/    # Common utilities
```
- **Pros**: Supports multiple apps, clear separation
- **Cons**: Overkill for single CLI, encourages premature abstraction
- **Why not**: We're one CLI tool, not multiple apps

## Decision

We adopt a **CLI-first package organization** with optional public packages:

```
ckeletin-go/
├── main.go                    # Entry point (only root-level .go file)
│
├── cmd/                       # CLI command implementations
│   ├── root.go                # Root command + global setup
│   ├── ping.go                # Feature commands
│   ├── docs.go
│   └── *.go                   # Additional commands
│
├── internal/                  # Private implementation
│   ├── ping/                  # Business logic packages
│   ├── docs/
│   ├── config/                # Infrastructure packages
│   ├── logger/
│   └── ui/
│
├── pkg/                       # (Optional) Standalone reusable packages
│   └── <package>/             # Must NOT import from internal/
│
├── scripts/                   # Build and validation scripts
├── test/integration/          # Integration tests
└── docs/                      # Documentation
```

### Key Principles

**1. Optional `pkg/` Directory**
- `pkg/` MAY be used for standalone, reusable packages
- Packages in `pkg/` must NOT import from `internal/` (enforced by validation)
- These are truly standalone libraries useful to external Go projects
- Requires conscious decision: you're committing to maintain a public API

**Criteria for `pkg/` packages:**
1. No dependencies on `internal/` packages
2. Useful to external Go projects (not just this CLI)
3. Complete documentation (`doc.go`)
4. Comprehensive tests
5. You're willing to maintain API compatibility

**If your project is purely a CLI tool**, omit `pkg/` to signal "CLI only" intent.

**2. `internal/` for Private Implementation**
- Go's `internal/` visibility rules prevent external imports
- Freedom to refactor without breaking external consumers
- No semantic versioning burden for internal APIs
- CLI-specific business logic belongs here

**3. `cmd/` for CLI Interface**
- Only public interface is the command-line tool itself
- Cobra commands live here (framework isolation)
- Ultra-thin wrappers (~20-30 lines, see [ADR-001](001-ultra-thin-command-pattern.md))
- No business logic in this layer

**4. `main.go` at Root**
- Single entry point at project root
- Only root-level `.go` file allowed
- Keeps root directory clean
- Conventional Go application pattern

**5. Auxiliary Directories Allowed**
- `scripts/` - Build, validation, and utility scripts
- `test/` - Integration and E2E tests
- `docs/` - Documentation (ADRs, guides)
- `testdata/` - Test fixtures
- `.github/` - CI/CD configuration
- These do NOT contain production Go packages

### Enforcement Rules

**✅ Allowed:**
- `main.go` at root (entry point)
- All packages in `cmd/`, `internal/`, or `pkg/`
- Go files in `scripts/` (build tools, not packages)
- Test files anywhere (`*_test.go`)
- `pkg/` packages that are standalone (no `internal/` imports)

**❌ Forbidden:**
- `.go` files at root except `main.go` and `main_test.go`
- Business logic in root directory
- `pkg/` packages that import from `internal/` (they must be standalone)

### Enforcement

**1. Filesystem Checks**
```bash
task validate:package-organization
```
Validates:
- No `.go` files at root except `main.go` and `main_test.go`
- All packages in `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `scripts/`, or `test/`
- `pkg/` packages do NOT import from `internal/` (standalone requirement)

**2. Integrated into Quality Pipeline**
```bash
task check  # Includes package organization validation
```

**3. CI Enforcement**
- Runs on every PR
- Fails if organization rules violated
- Prevents architectural drift

## Consequences

### Positive

**1. Clear Project Identity**
- File structure immediately shows "CLI-first, with optional public packages"
- Clear intent: CLI is the product, `pkg/` packages are bonus reusable components
- Onboarding faster (no question about where code goes)

**2. Internal Freedom**
- Can refactor `internal/` without breaking external consumers
- No semantic versioning burden for internal APIs
- Rapid iteration without fear

**3. Intentional Public API**
- `pkg/` packages require conscious decision and criteria checklist
- Forces quality commitment: docs, tests, API stability
- Maintains focus on CLI while allowing reusable components (e.g., `checkmate`)

**4. Enforcement Automation**
- `task validate:package-organization` catches violations
- CI prevents architectural drift
- No reliance on code review alone

**5. Go Ecosystem Alignment**
- `internal/` uses Go's visibility rules
- Conventional `cmd/` and `main.go` placement
- Familiar to Go developers

### Negative

**1. API Maintenance Burden (active cost)**
- Packages in `pkg/` require API stability commitment (e.g., `checkmate` is actively maintained)
- Semantic versioning applies to public packages
- Must maintain backwards compatibility — this is an intentional trade-off

**2. Strict Structure**
- Cannot "just add a package at root"
- Must think about placement (cmd/ vs internal/ vs pkg/)
- More structure than flat layout

**3. Potential Over-Engineering**
- For tiny projects, this might be overkill
- Adds directory overhead for single-file utilities

### Mitigations

**1. Documentation**
- This ADR explains the organization strategy
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) shows HOW packages organize
- Clear guidance for contributors

**2. Standalone Enforcement**
- `pkg/` packages cannot import `internal/` - enforced by validation
- This ensures `pkg/` packages are truly reusable
- Prevents tight coupling between public and private code

**3. Examples**
- Current codebase demonstrates pattern
- Template files guide new code placement
- `scripts/validate-package-organization.sh` gives instant feedback

## Implementation Details

### Current State Validation

The current project **follows this pattern**:
- ✅ `pkg/` contains only standalone packages (no `internal/` imports)
- ✅ CLI-specific implementation in `internal/` and `cmd/`
- ✅ Only `main.go` and `main_test.go` at root
- ✅ Auxiliary directories (`scripts/`, `test/`, `docs/`) present

This ADR **documents the organization strategy** and adds enforcement.

### When to Use `pkg/`

Create packages in `pkg/` when you want to expose a public Go API.

**Questions to ask first:**
1. Is this package useful to external Go projects?
2. Can it work standalone (no `internal/` dependencies)?
3. Are you willing to maintain API compatibility?
4. Does it have complete documentation and tests?

**If yes to all:** Create the package in `pkg/`, document the public API, commit to stability.

**If no:** Keep everything in `internal/`, users interact via CLI binary.

**Key rule:** `pkg/` packages must NOT import from `internal/`. This ensures they are truly standalone and reusable. The validation script enforces this.

### Adding New Packages

**For new CLI features:**
1. Create business logic in `internal/<feature>/`
2. Create command in `cmd/<feature>.go`
3. No need to update validation (automatically covered)

**For new commands:**
1. Follow [ADR-001](001-ultra-thin-command-pattern.md) (ultra-thin pattern)
2. Follow [ADR-009](009-layered-architecture-pattern.md) (layering rules)
3. Run `task validate:package-organization` to verify

**For new reusable packages:**
1. Create package in `pkg/<package>/`
2. Ensure NO imports from `internal/` (standalone requirement)
3. Add `doc.go` with package documentation
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Run `task validate:package-organization` to verify standalone status
