# Calculate coverage ourselves, excluding TUI and demo code

# When using -coverpkg=./..., each test binary emits coverage data for ALL
# packages. gocovmerge can produce duplicate entries for the same block with
# different hit counts (e.g., 0 from binaries that don't touch the code, >0
# from the package's own tests). We deduplicate by taking the maximum hit
# count per unique block before calculating coverage.
#
# Exclusions:
#   - *_tui.go: Legacy TUI file naming convention
#   - internal/check/executor.go: TUI executor (split from check_tui.go)
#   - internal/check/summary.go: TUI summary rendering (split from check_tui.go)
#   - /demo/: Demo code for documentation
#   - internal/embedding/: ONNX/hugot model inference — exercised in integration
#     tests with real model files, not unit-testable in CI without the runtime.
#     Tracked for future improvement (see AGENTS.md / roadmap).
#   - cmd/dev_progress.go: //go:build dev demo command for progress UI rendering.
#     Timing-sensitive spinners/bars; exercised by eye, not unit tests.
#   - cmd/check.go: //go:build dev wrapper that runs the full test suite via
#     internal/check.Executor. Unit-testing this would mean tests-within-tests.

# Calculate per-package coverage from go test output.
#
# The primary coverage file (coverage.txt) uses -coverpkg=./... which instruments
# each source file once per test binary. This creates overlapping coverage blocks
# with different boundaries that inflate the total statement count and undercount
# actual coverage. For accurate threshold enforcement, we generate a separate
# per-package coverage profile where each package is only instrumented once.
