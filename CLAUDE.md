# Claude Code Guidelines for ckeletin-go

**Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first** — it contains all project knowledge (architecture, commands, conventions, testing, licensing). This file contains Claude-specific behavioral rules only.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **TDD: write tests FIRST, commit together** — Always write failing tests before implementation code. Test + implementation go in one atomic commit. Never commit tests without the code that makes them pass, or code without its tests
2. **`task check` before every commit** — Non-negotiable, runs all quality checks
3. **Commands ≤30 lines** — `cmd/*.go` files wire things together; logic goes in `internal/`
4. **Use `config.Key*` constants** — Never hardcode config strings; run `task generate:config:key-constants` after registry changes
5. **Never reduce test coverage** — 85% minimum overall, use `testify/assert`
6. **Check licenses after `go get`** — Run `task check:license:source` immediately
7. **Never `--no-verify`** — Ask user permission first with justification
8. **ALWAYS use `task` commands** — See `.claude/rules/task-commands.md` for the full translation table

**When rules conflict:** Security → License compliance → Correctness → Coverage → Style

## Command Translation (MANDATORY)

**STOP — use the task equivalent, not the raw command:**

| Instead of (NEVER) | Use (ALWAYS) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| `go test ./...` | `task test` |
| `go build` | `task build` |
| `golangci-lint run` | `task lint` |
| `goimports -w .` | `task format` |
| `go vet ./...` | `task lint` |
| `go mod tidy` | `task tidy` |
| Multiple checks manually | `task check` |

**ONLY exception:** `go test -v -run TestName ./path/...` for debugging a specific test.

## Quick Decision Trees

```
Where does this code go?
├── CLI command entry point? → cmd/<name>.go (≤30 lines)
├── Business logic? → internal/<name>/
├── Reusable public API? → pkg/
└── Test helpers? → test/ or *_test.go

Which command to run?
├── All tests? → task test
├── Debug one test? → go test -v -run TestName ./path/...
├── Before commit? → task check (MANDATORY)
├── Format code? → task format
└── Quick compile? → go build ./... (OK for iteration)

Which log level?
├── Can return this error? → log.Debug() + return err
├── User input error? → Formatted output only (no log)
├── Important event in normal flow? → log.Info()
├── Recoverable issue needing attention? → log.Warn()
└── Unrecoverable system failure/bug? → log.Error()
```

## Claude-Specific Behaviors

- **Use the Edit tool** for file modifications — NEVER use `sed`, `awk`, or shell redirects to edit code
- **NEVER use `--no-verify`** on git commands. Only justified when: pre-commit hook is actually broken (not just failing), emergency security patch with user approval, or user has explicitly approved after reviewing justification. **Never justified:** "I'll fix it later", "The tests are flaky", "It works on my machine".
- **Unused variables**: When lint flags them, investigate intent before deleting. See `.claude/rules/unused-vars.md`.
- **Don't work around failures** — if `task check` fails, fix the root cause. Read the error output. Check `Taskfile.yml` to understand what the task does. If stuck, ask the user.
- **Don't propose changes to code you haven't read** — always read files before suggesting modifications
- **Read ADRs before architectural changes** — check `.ckeletin/docs/adr/*.md`

## Claude-Specific Setup

See `.claude/rules/claude-setup.md` for session initialization details.

Tools auto-install via SessionStart hook. If tools fail: `bash .ckeletin/scripts/install_tools.sh`

After Go upgrade: `task setup` to rebuild tools. Verify with: `task --list && task test`

## Anti-Patterns (Consolidated)

| DON'T | DO |
|-------|-----|
| `go test ./...` for full suite | `task test` |
| `goimports -w .` | `task format` |
| `git commit` without checks | `task check && git commit` |
| Put logic in `cmd/*.go` | Put logic in `internal/*` |
| Use `sed`/`awk` for edits | Use the Edit tool |
| Hardcode `"app.log.level"` | Use `config.KeyAppLogLevel` |
| Forget to regenerate constants | `task generate:config:key-constants` |
| Write implementation before tests | Write failing test FIRST, then implement (TDD) |
| Commit tests and implementation separately | Atomic commits: test + implementation together |
| Squash merge branches/PRs | Normal merge (preserve atomic commit history) |
| Skip tests for "simple" code | Write tests (85% coverage is mandatory) |
| Mock everything | Use dependency injection ([ADR-003]) |
| Add deps without license check | `go get pkg && task check:license:source` |
| `fmt.Println()` for logging | `log.Info()` with structured fields |
| `log.Error()` for returnable errors | `log.Debug()` + `return err` |
| Delete unused vars without checking | Investigate if they represent missing functionality |

## VaultMind — Your Long-Term Memory

You have a 123-note research knowledge base at `vaultmind-vault/` covering human memory, LLM memory architectures, retrieval systems, knowledge graphs, and cognitive science. All sources are verified real papers with DOIs/arXiv IDs.

**Use VaultMind BEFORE answering questions about topics in the vault.** It's faster and more accurate than your parametric knowledge.

```bash
# Quick answer with context (preferred — one command does it all)
vaultmind ask "spreading activation" --vault vaultmind-vault --json --budget 4000

# Search for specific topics
vaultmind search "query" --vault vaultmind-vault --json

# Get a specific note by ID
vaultmind note get <id> --vault vaultmind-vault --json

# Check vault health
vaultmind doctor --vault vaultmind-vault
```

Build the binary first if needed: `go build -o /tmp/vaultmind .`

The vault also contains design decisions (`decision-*` notes) that explain why VaultMind is built the way it is. Check these before proposing architectural changes.

## Known Rule Violations (These Have Happened Before)

- Writing implementation code before writing tests (TDD violation)
- Running `go test ./...` instead of `task test`
- Deleting unused variables without investigating if they represent planned functionality
- Using raw `go`/`golangci-lint`/`goimports` commands instead of `task` equivalents
- Using `sed` to edit files instead of the Edit tool

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
