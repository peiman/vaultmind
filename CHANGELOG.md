# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- SBOM vulnerability scan no longer blocks releases due to stale grype database
- Windows CI: fixed file locking in concurrent timing persistence tests
- CI: corrected fabricated SHA pins for cosign-installer and scan-action

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Agent-ready architecture**: Layered AI configuration stack (`AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md` → `.claude/rules/` → hooks → `task check`) enables AI coding agents to produce correct, well-structured code within enforced architectural patterns
- **Framework versioning**: `.ckeletin/VERSION` tracks framework version; `task ckeletin:version` displays it
- **Framework update dry-run**: `task ckeletin:update:dry-run` previews framework changes without applying them
- **Framework health check**: `task ckeletin:health` shows version, local modifications, update availability, and import consistency
- **Pre-update compatibility check**: `task ckeletin:update:check-compatibility` tests latest framework against your code before committing
- **Improved command generator**: `task generate:command name=<name>` now scaffolds the full pattern — `cmd/`, `internal/`, tests, and config — in one command (was 8 manual steps)
- **Config-time validation**: Invalid config values (colors, log levels) are now caught at startup with clear error messages, not during command execution
- **AST-based import rewriting**: Framework updates and scaffold init now use `go/ast` for import path rewriting instead of `sed`, eliminating corruption of comments and string constants
- **XDG Base Directory compliance**: Platform-aware config, cache, and data paths (Linux XDG spec, macOS conventions, Windows standard paths)
- **Parallel check execution**: `--parallel` flag for `ckeletin-go check` runs checks concurrently within categories
- **Hybrid Go check command**: 23 checks across 6 categories with `--fail-fast` support and beautiful terminal output via `pkg/checkmate`
- **Scaffold workflow**: `task init name=myapp module=...` initializes a new project; `task ckeletin:update` pulls framework improvements
- **Development-only commands** (build tag `dev`):
  - `dev config` — configuration inspector (list, show, export, validate, search)
  - `dev doctor` — environment health checker
  - `dev progress` — development progress display
- **Golden file testing**: `task test:golden` for CLI output snapshot testing with cross-platform normalization
- **Fast quality checks**: `task check:fast` for rapid iteration (~2-3 min vs ~5-8 min)
- **Conventional commit enforcement**: Lefthook `commit-msg` hook validates commit message format
- **Binary signing**: Releases signed with keyless cosign via OIDC for supply chain verification
- **SBOM vulnerability scanning**: Release artifacts scanned with grype before publishing
- **SLSA provenance**: Cryptographic attestation of build environment for releases
- **Weekly fuzz testing**: Automated CI workflow runs fuzz tests every Sunday

### Changed

- **README restructured**: Leads with Smart + AI-agent readiness; new "Agent-Ready Architecture" and "Who Is This For?" sections; framework story integrated throughout
- **AGENTS.md reframed**: Positioned as a reusable reference implementation pattern for agent-ready codebases
- **`task build` defaults to dev builds**: Use `task build:prod` for production (previous behavior)
- **`task test` includes dev command tests**: Use `task test:prod` for production-only testing
- **Framework/project separation**: Framework code in `.ckeletin/`, tasks namespaced as `ckeletin:*`
- **Config path defaults**: XDG-style paths (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<app>/config.yaml`) replace legacy `~/.<app>.yaml`
- **Go version**: Updated to 1.26.1
- **Windows support clarified**: Core functionality supported; interactive features may have limitations

### Security

- **Cosign binary signing** for release verification
- **SBOM scanning** at release time catches high-severity vulnerabilities
- **SLSA provenance** enables cryptographic build verification
- **Semgrep SAST** now runs on pull requests (previously main-only)
- **Atomic timing writes** prevent data corruption on concurrent check runs

### Removed

- **`.cursor/rules/` directory**: Consolidated into `CLAUDE.md`
- **Legacy `~/.<app>.yaml` config path**: Replaced by XDG-style paths

## [0.8.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added

- **Test Quality Improvements**:
  - Added `testify/assert` and `testify/require` for cleaner test assertions
  - Created `internal/testutil` package with standardized platform skip helpers:
    - `SkipOnWindows(t)` - Skip tests on Windows
    - `SkipOnWindowsWithReason(t, reason)` - Skip with custom message
    - `SkipOnNonWindows(t)` - Skip on non-Windows platforms
    - `SkipOnPlatform(t, platform)` - Skip on specific platform
  - Added `getExitCode()` helper in integration tests to eliminate duplicate error handling code
  - Created comprehensive `docs/testing-guide.md`:
    - Test patterns (table-driven, SETUP-EXECUTION-ASSERTION)
    - Platform-specific testing guidelines
    - Anti-patterns to avoid
    - Integration testing patterns
    - ADR-003 compliance examples
  - **Integrated race detection into quality checks**: `task check` now runs `test:race` automatically to catch concurrency bugs
  - **Achieved 100% coverage on cmd/ package**: Added test for `runPing` wrapper function (cmd/ping_test.go:222-256)
  - **Added ADR-000 task naming validator**: Automatically enforces `action:target` pattern
    - New task: `task validate:task-naming` (integrated into `task check`)
    - Provides smart suggestions for violations (e.g., "fuzz" → "Did you mean 'test:fuzz'?")
    - Detects typos using pattern matching (e.g., "tset:race" → "Did you mean 'test:race'?")
    - Prevents naming drift and guides contributors to correct patterns
  - **Added fuzz testing for config parsing**:
    - `FuzzValidateConfigValue` in internal/config/limits_test.go - tests string limits, nested structures, type conversions
    - `FuzzValidate` in internal/config/validator/validator_test.go - end-to-end YAML parsing with malformed input
    - `FuzzFindUnknownKeys` in internal/config/validator/validator_test.go - recursive key traversal with special characters
    - New task commands: `task test:fuzz`, `task test:fuzz:config`, `task test:fuzz:validator`
    - Configurable duration: `task test:fuzz FUZZTIME=1h` (default: 10s per function)
    - Not included in `task check` (manual/exploratory testing only)
  - **Enhanced `task doctor` with Go version compatibility checking**:
    - Detects when dev tools (go-licenses, golangci-lint, gotestsum, govulncheck) were built with older Go version
    - Shows warning with specific tools and their build versions: `⚠️ built with go1.25.3 (current: go1.25.4)`
    - Suggests rebuild command: `task setup`
    - Prevents compatibility issues (e.g., go-licenses failing with "package does not have module info" errors)
    - Added documentation in CLAUDE.md about rebuilding tools after Go upgrades

- **Automated scaffold initialization** (`task init`):
  - Single command to customize module path and binary name: `task init name=myapp module=github.com/myuser/myapp`
  - Automatically updates 40+ files including all Go imports, configs, and templates
  - Cross-platform pure Go implementation (Windows/Linux/macOS)
  - Includes formatting and validation
  - Comprehensive integration test ensures reliability
  - Eliminates 15-20 minutes of manual find/replace work
  - Example: `task init name=mycompany-cli module=github.com/mycompany/mycompany-cli`
- **ADR-009: Layered Architecture Pattern**:
  - Documents 4-layer architecture (Entry → Command → Business Logic → Infrastructure)
  - Explains dependency rules and framework independence
  - Automated enforcement via go-arch-lint
  - New task: `task validate:layering` checks layer dependencies
  - Integrated into `task check` quality pipeline
  - Configuration: `.go-arch-lint.yml` defines components and allowed dependencies
  - Prevents architectural drift through CI validation
  - Note: Adding new business logic packages requires updating `.go-arch-lint.yml`
- **ADR-010: Package Organization Strategy**:
  - Documents CLI-first package organization (no `pkg/`, all implementation in `internal/`)
  - Explains why ckeletin-go is a CLI application, not a library
  - Automated enforcement via validation script
  - New task: `task validate:package-organization` checks directory structure
  - Integrated into `task check` quality pipeline
  - Validates: No Go code in `pkg/`, only `main.go` at root, all packages in expected locations
  - Prevents accidental public API surface expansion
  - Complements ADR-009 layering rules
- **ADR-001 & ADR-002 Extensions - Implementation Patterns**:
  - Extended ADR-001 with two implementation patterns:
    - **Command Metadata Pattern**: Declarative command definitions in `internal/config/commands/`, factory functions for construction
    - **Executor Pattern**: Business logic in `internal/*/executor.go` with `Execute()` method for framework independence
  - Extended ADR-002 with Type-Safe Config Consumption pattern:
    - Commands use `getConfigValueWithFlags[T]()` helper with generated constants
    - Config passed as typed structs to executors (e.g., `ping.Config`)
    - New task: `task validate:config-consumption` enforces pattern
    - Prevents direct `viper.Get*()` calls in command files (except whitelisted: helpers.go, root.go, flags.go)
  - Removed 3 TODO markers from ARCHITECTURE.md, replaced with ADR pattern references
  - Added validation to Pattern Enforcement table

  - Refactored all task names to follow `action:target[:subvariant]` pattern
  - Updated all documentation (ADRs, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, cmd/README.md) to use new task names
  - Examples: `check-defaults` → `validate:defaults`, `deps:check` → `check:deps`, `release:test` → `test:release`
  - Improved discoverability with consistent action-based grouping (all `check:*`, `validate:*`, `generate:*`, etc.)
- **README.md refactoring** (SSOT/DRY compliance):
  - Documented new `task doctor` command for environment diagnostics
  - Documented `config validate` command with exit codes and security features
  - Updated Architecture section to emphasize project vision and principles

### Fixed

- **ADR-000 compliance in CI**:
  - Updated test-matrix job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use `task` commands instead of direct `go` commands
  - Changed `go build -v ./...` → `task build`

- **Configuration discovery improvements**:
  - Config search now includes current directory (`./.ckeletin-go.yaml`) with higher priority than home directory
  - Application no longer requires `$HOME` environment variable (gracefully falls back to current directory search only)
  - Updated configuration search documentation to match actual implementation
- **Runtime log-level adjustment now functional**:
